# Movie-Classification-Project-
School project using numpy and datascience modules to predict movie genre from movie script diction of k-word selections using nearest-neighbor algorithm. 

Note that the datascience module is available to all but it was originally created by UC Berkeley professors in guidance to teaching statistical computing. I acknolwedge 
that other packages might have been more useful in doing this same project. Projects using industry standard modules will come.
